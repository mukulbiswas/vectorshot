# Readme

## Purpose:
    Library to renders simple d3.js charts built in node.js on the serverside that can be included in any 
    node.js project.

## History: 
    CelebalTech is building chatbot applications on Microsoft Bot framework which has complex requirements
    cannot be designed using adaptivecards.io. The rendered images based on the input data would be placed
    inside the adaptive cards to achieve those complex visualizations.

## Intent:
    D3.js has many readymade visualizations for charts and graphs - simple and complex. I intend to use the
    simple ones for quick business charts. The library will accept database recordsets in JSON format and
    return an SVG as a string that can be placed in the placeholder that is capable of rendering it.
